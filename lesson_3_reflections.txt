When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

This would be helpful if you need to work on a different computer or if you are getting help 
from someone else.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling the changes would allow you to review what changes have been made before committing them,
in case work from another person requires review. This would also allow you to complete logical 
steps and save so that it is easier to refer to changes incrementally.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks: copies of a repository on GitHub to a new repository on GitHub - Use when you'd like to
access the repository from remote locations or share with another user.
Clones: copies of a repository from GitHub or a local repository to a new local repository - 
Use when you'd like a copy of a repository on your local server.
Branches: variants of the master commit history - Use when you'd like to experiment with 
different features at the same time as working on the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You are working with the most recent changes, so that any editions you make are not 
insurmountably drastic.
